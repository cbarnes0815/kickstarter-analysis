# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to provide two detailed analysis of the kickstarter dataset. The analysis provided will show the outcomes based on the launch dates and funding goals for plays, which will be represented as "Outcomes based on Goals" and the "Outcomes based on Launch Dates".

## Analysis and Challenges

Below the data and visualization charts are displayed. The first Analysis provided is the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date". This analysis will include a pivot table and line chart. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I performed the Outcomes Bases on Launch Date analysis by first filtering the Kickstarter dataset by year. That was achieved by creating a new field and executing the year function. A Pivot table was created with the updated **Kickstarter** dataset, to display **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**. The pivot table was filter by **Parent Category** and **year**. The results displayed are the number of **canceled**, **failed**, and **successful** theater projects by each month of the year. This data is portrayed in a line graph that is attached below, titled **Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date**.

The information is displaying that the most successful theater projects were launched in May and June. There are **111** Successful projects in May and **100** Successful projects in June (reference above chart). 

### Challenges

One challenge I had to overcome was correctly displaying the Pivot table information. Some of the fields were autogenerated by excel when the new table was created. For example when the **"Date Created Conversion"** field is dropped into **"Rows"** the fields **Years2**, **Quarters** are auto generated. These can be removed by dragging them out of "Rows". 

Another challenge I faced was correctly displaying desired rows and column in the pivot table. There was a "(blank)" row and column present in the table. The way I removed them was by filtering the **row labels** and **column labels** to uncheck the "(blank)" box.
