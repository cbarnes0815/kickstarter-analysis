# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to provide two detailed analysis of the kickstarter dataset. The analysis provided will show the outcomes based on the launch dates and funding goals for plays, which will be represented as "Outcomes based on Goals" and the "Outcomes based on Launch Dates".

## Analysis and Challenges

Below the data and visualization charts are displayed. The first Analysis provided is the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date". This analysis will include a pivot table and line chart. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I performed the Outcomes Bases on Launch Date analysis by first filtering the Kickstarter dataset by year. That was creating a new field and executing the year function. A Pivot table was created with the undated **Kickstarter** dataset, to display **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**. The pivot table was filter by Parent Category and year. The results displayed are the number of canceled, failed, and successful theater projects by each month of the year. This data is portrayed in a line graph that is attached below, titled **Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date**.
